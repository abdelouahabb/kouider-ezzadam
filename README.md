Simple scripts to do a brute force to find a reverse md5 :D

The job was for someone, he was not satisfacted, so i release it here, that is how i work: if you dont like the job, i make it public.

`hasher.py` is used to generate a dictionnary of numbers + their hashs.

`comparer.py` is used to compare a given hash on the dictionnary generated from `hasher.py`

`hasher-comparer.py` is used to do the task of the two, but in memory, so be careful to use a big range!

How to use it
===============

just run the script with the command `-h` to see the argument you provide.
